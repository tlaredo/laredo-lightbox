# laredo-lightbox

Laredo Lightbox is a mobile-responsive web application that extracts photos from a Flickr photo gallery and presents them in a clean grid layout. When you click on a photo, you can view it in lightbox view and navigate between the different photos in the gallery.

## Notes About Demo

This was built with vanilla JavaScript and with no external libraries. For demonstration purposes, I hardcoded the URL for the photo gallery in my JavaScript file. The photo gallery that I used in this demo is [Camera Day](https://www.flickr.com/photos/flickr/galleries/72157669781709702/). The cover photo, gallery title, gallery description, number of photos, and photo sources are all extracted from Flickr's API.

## API Reference

I used two Flickr API methods in this project:

[flickr.urls.lookupGallery](https://www.flickr.com/services/api/flickr.urls.lookupGallery.html).

* Input: `api_key`, `gallery URL`

* Returns: `gallery_id`, gallery `title`, `description`, `count_photos`, and the elements needed to get the gallery's cover photo

[flickr.urls.getPhotos](https://www.flickr.com/services/api/flickr.galleries.getPhotos.html).

* Input: `api_key`, `gallery_id`

* Returns: Standard Photo Response (XML format), which contains each photo's `farm`, `id`, `secret`, and `server` ids.

With these four ids, I used string concatenation to generate each photo's source URL. The format for each photo source URL is `https://farm{farm}.staticflickr.com/{server}/{id}_{secret}.jpg`
